    "# Tutorial on Benchmarking Inference Code\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through the steps and components necessary to launch run A2Perf's inference benchmark on your trained agent . your first A2Perf submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Install A2Perf\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure you have A2Perf installed on your system. For detailed instructions, please refer to our [Installation Guide](../basic_usage.md#Installation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Trained Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "You need a directory containing your trained agent. This could be a saved model, weights file, or any other format your agent uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission folder structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Your submission should be placed in the `A2Perf/a2perf/a2perf_benchmark_submission/` directory. The structure should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "A2Perf/\n",
    "├── a2perf/\n",
    "│   ├── a2perf_benchmark_submission/\n",
    "│   │   ├── init.py\n",
    "│   │   ├── train.py\n",
    "│   │   ├── inference.py\n",
    "│   │   ├── requirements.txt\n",
    "│   │   └── [your supporting files and directories]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started quickly, you can use our template repository as a starting point. You can find the template at:\n",
    "\n",
    "[https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/a2perf-benchmark-submission/tree/template](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/a2perf-benchmark-submission/tree/template)\n",
    "\n",
    "This template provides the basic structure and files needed for your submission. You can clone this repository and modify it to fit your specific implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of files:\n",
    "- `__init__.py`:\n",
    "The `__init__.py` file can be an empty file. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `train.py`:\n",
    "The `train.py` file includes the function `train()`, which A2Perf calls for the training of your algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `inference.py`\n",
    "Next, the `inference.py` file is subsequently used for benchmarking the trained model.\n",
    "This file includes several key functions.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "__`load_model(env)`:__\n",
    "This function loads and returns the trained model. A2Perf passes the environment that is being tested via the `env` parameter. This allows the model loading logic to use any context needed, such as the environment name.\n",
    "\\\n",
    "__`preprocess_observation(observation)`:__\n",
    "Preprocesses the observation before feeding it to the model. If no preprocessing is required, simply return the initial observation.\n",
    "\\\n",
    "__`infer_once(model, observation)`:__\n",
    "Passes a single observation to the loaded model and returns the predicted action. This function performs a single inference step.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `requirements.txt`:\n",
    "Specifies any package dependencies required to run the submission code. This file may include version constraints for the dependencies. Having an explicit requirements file ensures a consistent environment for evaluation.\n",

    "## Launching locally\n",
    "### Launching with Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the inference benchmark, we use XManager to launch with Docker. We need to define several flags in the command line interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Required Flags:\n",
    "- `experiment-name`: Name of your experiment.\n",
    "- `root-dir`: Base directory for logs and results. This is important for inference as it's passed to the inference method.\n",
    "- `domain`: Specifies which environment you're testing (e.g., WebNavigation-v0).\n",
    "- `submission-gin-config-path`: Path to the GIN config for your chosen domain.\n",
    "- `participant-module-path`: Path to the module of your submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optional Flags:\n",
    "- `participant-args`: Additional arguments to pass to your submission module.\n",
    "- `verbosity`: Level of output detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Command:\n",
    "To run the benchmark, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "xmanager launch xm_launch.py -- \\\n",
    "  --experiment-name=test \\\n",
    "  --root-dir=~/gcs/a2perf/experiments \\\n",
    "  --domain=WebNavigation-v0 \\\n",
    "  --submission-gin-config-path=rl_perf/submission/configs/web_navigation/train.gin \\\n",
    "  --participant-module-path=a2perf/a2perf_benchmark_submission \\\n",
    "  --participant-args=\"gin_config_path=configs/local/WebNavigation-v0/ddqn.gin\" \\\n",
    "  --verbosity=2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Notes:\n",
    "1. Ensure you're running the command from the root `A2Perf` directory.\n",
    "2. The `participant-module-path` should be `a2perf/a2perf_benchmark_submission` unless you've modified the repository structure.\n",
    "3. Adjust the GIN config paths as necessary for your specific environment and setup.\n",
    "4. Ensure you have write permissions and sufficient storage space in the specified `root-dir`.\n",
    "5. Make sure your submission module can handle the additional arguments passed via `--participant-args`.\n",
