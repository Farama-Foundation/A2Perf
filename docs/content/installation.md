# Installation

To install `minigrid`, the easiest way is to use `pip`:

```bash
pip install minigrid
```

However, if you would like to build on top of `minigrid`, you would need to install it from source. To do this, first clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid.git
```

Then, install the package:

```bash
cd Minigrid
python3 -m pip install .
```

If you want to install the package in [development mode](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html), use the following command instead:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

An installation in development mode (i.e., an editable install) is useful if you want to modify the source code of `minigrid` and have your changes take effect immediately.
