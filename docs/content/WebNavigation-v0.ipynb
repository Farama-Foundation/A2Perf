    "The action should be passed as a scalar. Two types of actions are possible. Firstly, abstract navigation allows to directly refer to an element, and the profile is irrelevant. In this case, the action is converted to a tuple. If abstract navigation is desired, we have to pass `use_conceptual=True` when initializing the environment. Secondly, the action can refer to a pair of elements and profile fields. The agent will then enter the value of the profile key corresponding to the selected DOM element.\n",

    "When performing one step in the environment, we are given the option to return the raw state of wrapped state. To return the raw state, we pass `raw_state=True`, by default, the observation is wrapped. \\\n",
    "The wrapped structure will return a dictionary with the following keys: `profile_key, profile_value, profile_key_mask, profile_value_mask, dom_elements, dom_profile_joint_mask, time_step, dom_attribute_mask, dom_profile_intersection, dom_profile_intersection_mask, dom_features`, where the values are arrays.\n",

The first keys of the wrapped observation relate to the profile, while the last few relate to the DOM tree. The profile of the webpage is the user profile, which contains keys and values which need to be filled in. When booking flights, this could be `{\"Departure Date\": \"Friday\", \"Destination Airport\": \"Los Angeles (LAX)\"}`. These keys and values are subsequently embedded into vectors. All keys and values are embedded in fixed length vectors, which raises the need for padding the shorter embeddings. This is where the masks comes in, the mask contains ones where the embedding relates to the original key or value, and zeros where the embedding is padded. \n",

    "Next, the intersection between the profile and DOM elements is embedded and returned. For each profile field key and value tokens (such as `[\"first\", \"name\"]`) and for each element attribute tokens (such as `[\"initial\", \"name\", \":\"]`), the overlapping tokens are embedded. The intersection is a 5D tensor of shape `(number of elements, max number of attributes, number of profile fields, number of action types (2), max sequence length)`.\n",

    "At every timestep, the agent receives a small penalty to encourage efficient navigation. Next, a potential-based positive reward is given to the agent after successfully linking a key to a field and entering the correct value. Lastly, the agent receives a task success reward (1.0 or -1.0) when the final state is reached or a time out is encountered. \n",

    "To give an example, consider booking flights where the agent has the following profile:\n",
    "`{\"Departure Date\": \"Friday\", \"Destination Airport\": \"Los Angeles (LAX)\"}`, which has two fields (Departure Date and Destination Airport). The agent starts by picking a field, and tries to find the correpsonding text box in the page. The value corresponding to the field (eg. Destination Airport), is subsequently typed into the text box. If this is correct, the agent will receive a positive reward of 1/2, where the denominator, 2, is the number of fields in the profile."
