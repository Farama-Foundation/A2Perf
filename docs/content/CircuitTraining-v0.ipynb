Firstly, we have to define the number of websites that needs to be created, with the `num_websites` parameter. Next, we have to either specify a difficulty for the websites or we can provide a design. When creating the environment we thus either specify `difficulty` or `designs`.\n",

    "| `num_websites` | int | `None` | The number of websites to be created. |\n",

A random agent has a >=50% chance of completing a level 1 website, a >=25% chance of completing a level 2 website and a >=10% chance of completing a level 3 website. You either define `difficulty` or `designs`, not both.|\n",
    "| `designs` | Optional, list[dict[str, Any]] | `None` | You can pass the design for a number of websites, where each website corresponds to one dictionary in the list. If you specify designs, note that you need to specify at least the number of websites defined with `num_websites`. The designs returned is then `num_websites` randomly sampled from `designs`.
