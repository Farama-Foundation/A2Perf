    "# A beginners guide to using A2Perf\n",
    "This notebook walks through the steps and components necessary to submit your first A2Perf submission. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Python quick start\n",
    "To install the latest release of A2Perf, just run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/A2Perf.git\n",
    "cd A2Perf\n",
    "git submodule sync --recursive\n",
    "git submodule update --init --recursive\n",
    "pip install -e .\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- ### Linux\n",
    "If having issues with `mpi4py`, run:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "sudo apt-get install mpi\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "If using conda, use:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge mpi\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py\n",
    "``` -->\n",
    "Both x86-64 and Arch64 (ARM64) architectures are supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- ### macOS\n",
    "Both Intel and Apple Silicon CPUs are supported.\n",
    "Python version <3.9 is supported.\n",
    "On Apple Silicon (M1 and M2), make sure you are using Python/Pip for Apple Silicon.\n",
    "If necessary, use\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "brew install open-mpi\n",
    "brew install mpi4py\n",
    "```\n",
    "If using conda, use:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge open-mpi\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py\n",
    "``` -->\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the Windows version is not as well-tested as Linux and macOS versions.\n",
    "It can be used for development and testing but if you want to conduct serious (time and resource-extensive) experiments on Windows,\n",
    "please consider using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) or [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) with Linux version.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- ## Installation\n",
    "First things first, we need to install A2Perf on our machine. A2Perf currently offers support for Python versions 3.7 to 3.9. Follow the commands below to clone and configure the repository:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/A2Perf.git\n",
    "cd A2Perf\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "__Troubleshooting:__\n",
    "If you are having issues with `mpi` or `mpi4py` when using conda, use:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge mpi mpi4py\n",

    "# Submission folder\n",
    "In order to benchmark your reinforcement learning algorithms, your submission should have the following structure: \n",
    "```\n",
    "├── my_submission\n",

    "│   ├── train.py\n",

    "- `__init__.py`:\n",
    "The `__init__.py` file can be an empty file. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `train.py`:\n",
    "The `train.py` file includes the function `train()`, which A2Perf calls for the training of your algorithm. \n",

    "\n",
    "- `inference.py`\n",

    "\\\n",
    "__`load_model(env)`:__\n",
    "This function loads and returns the trained model. A2Perf passes the environment that is being tested via the `env` parameter. This allows the model loading logic to use any context needed, such as the environment name.\n",

    "Preprocesses the observation before feeding it to the model. If no preprocessing is required, simply return the initial observation.\n",

    "__`infer_once(model, observation)`:__\n",
    "Passes a single observation to the loaded model and returns the predicted action. This function performs a single inference step.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `requirements.txt`:\n",
    "Specifies any package dependencies required to run the submission code. This file may include version constraints for the dependencies. Having an explicit requirements file ensures a consistent environment for evaluation."

    "## Running the Benchmark\n",
    "To finally run the benchmark, we run the `A2Perf/rl_perf/submission/main_submission.py` file from a command line interface. We need to define several flags. While some of these flags are necessary for running the benchmark, other flags are optional.\\\n",

    "- `gin_config`: the path to the gin_config of the environment you want to run. For this tutorial, we use the quadruped_locomotion library. This file can be found under `A2Perf/rl_perf/submission/configs/quadruped_locomotion/train.gin`.\n",
    "- `participant_module_path`: the path to the module of your submission. This is the path to the `my_submission` folder is the folder structure section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional:\n",
    "- `root_dir`: base directory for logs and results. Defaults to `/tmp/xm_local`.\n",
    "- `metric_values_dir`: directory to save metric values.\n",
    "- `train_logs_dirs`: directories for train logs from all experiments. Defaults to `train_logs`.\n",
    "- `extra_gin_bindings`: extra GIN bindings to add configurations on the fly.\n",
    "- `run_offline_metrics_only`: boolean defining whether to run offline metrics only. Defaults to `False`.\n",

    "To run the benchmark, we use the following command:\n",
